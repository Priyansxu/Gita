    "47": "Krishna instructs Arjuna to focus on his prescribed duty, but not to be attached to the results of his actions.

    "63": "Krishna continues: from anger, delusion arises, and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool. This completes the description of the downward spiral resulting from sense attachment.",

    "64": "Krishna explains that one who can control the senses by following regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord and thus become free from all attachment and aversion. This verse shows how regulated sense control can lead to divine grace and freedom from duality.",

In this joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses.",

    "67": "Krishna uses an analogy, saying that as a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a person's intelligence. This vivid imagery illustrates the power of the senses to disturb one's spiritual equilibrium.",

    "68": "Therefore, Krishna concludes, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge. This verse reiterates the importance of sense control in achieving spiritual wisdom.",

    "69": "Krishna explains that what is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled, and what is awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage. This verse poetically describes the different perspectives of the spiritually realized and the materially engrossed.",

    "70": "Krishna uses another analogy, saying that a person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires - like rivers flowing into the ocean which is ever being filled but always remains calm - can alone achieve peace, not the person who strives to satisfy such desires. This beautiful imagery illustrates the state of inner peace achieved through detachment.",

    "71": "Krishna states that a person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego - he alone can attain real peace. This verse summarizes the qualities necessary for true peace.",
